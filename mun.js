  document.getElementById('hel').innerHTML='<center><h1>Message from the desk of Vice Chancellor</h1></center><br /><br /><p> The Indian higher education system is the second largest in the world in terms of number of institutions and enrollments. In spite of this achievement and progress during the past couple of years, the educational institutions are facing several challenges. The key challenges include lack of high quality research and shortage of faculty leading to sub-standard outcomes like poor employability. According to industry reports (NASSCOM, CII and FICCI), only 25 percent of technical graduates are employable. It is important to focus on improving the quality of faculty and enabling research environment at the institutions. The challenge before us is to create and sustain an education system that is responsive to the emerging dynamic environment.</p><br /><p>The youth are the future leaders who will transform their organizations, their countries and societies as a whole.</p><br /><p>I am very happy that brilliant students from the best Institutions of India and around the world are coming together at Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya for the debut edition of Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya  International Model United Nations Conference, SVVVIMUN&#39;16 on 21st,22nd and 23rd October 2016. With delegates from around the world applying to become a part of the conference, SVVVIMUN&#39;16 is a promising endeavor. Apart from a great response from students all over the country, we are also looking forward to students who would be coming from various other corners of the world. Keeping in mind the troubled times we live in, the theme of the conference this year is, &#34;Diversity to Bring Change.&#34; The conference would serve as a significant platform for the participating delegates to deliberate and debate on critical issues that concern the world. We have always seen that it is those students who take the extra initiative and have the passion and urge to do activities over and above their formal courses of study who become the leaders to drive change. With this conference we, at SVVV, aim to encourage interaction between students from around the globe through diplomatic discussions on pressing issues in a well simulated format similar to that of the United Nations. SVVVIMUN with its high standards has decided this time to be more inclusive in its approach by inviting intellectual minds related to the areas of diplomacy, social activism and politics to be a part of the coveted conference.<p><br /><p>The Model United Nations is the perfect platform to further most essential skills like communication, negotiation and leadership. It not only inculcates rich knowledge, but also teaches students indispensable human values. With students having fire in the belly to excel and the organizing committee dedicated to their work, SVVVIMUN 2016 is sure to provide excellent global exposure. I wish you all the very best for SVVVIMUN 2016. Hope you will have an enriching experience!</p><br /><p><strong>I am happy to invite you to be a part of the journey towards excellence.</strong></p><br /><p>Dr.Upinder Dhar<br>Vice Chancellor<br>Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya,Indore</p>';

Its analysis is used in the most considerate application of the Declaration of Human Rights and the preservation of international justice. Some of the topics the Third Committee has dealt with in the past include the advancement of women, protection of children, indigenous issues, the treatment of refugees, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through the elimination of racism and racial discrimination, and the promotion of the right to self- determination. SOCHUM has collaborated extensively with agencies like UNCEF, UNESCO, UNHCR, and UNODC, whose input has been paramount to confronting these severe social issues. Much like the other committees in the General Assembly, SOCHUM has limited administrative authority, in that it cannot demand certain actions to be taken. However, it is vital in analyzing serious social and cultural problems, initiating studies and making recommendations pertaining to these issues. In the past sixty-seven sessions of the General Assembly, the Third Committee has been of prime importance in its contributions to the realization of human rights and the reduction of international crime as well as a more fruitful international collaboration on social, humanitarian, cultural and educational forums.</p><br /><p><strong>&#62;Agenda:- Addressing the impact of juvenile delinquency and criminal behavior and measure to depreciate the trends</strong></p>';
